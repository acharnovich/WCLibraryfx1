This was my first full stack development project while obtaining my bachelor's at Penn State. 
We used Java, JSON, and JavaFX to create a library asset management system. 
A user can checkout books, search for assets, and create a profile. 

I will say with this being my first full Java project, the code can be rough at times, but this was designed to showcase project management and some Java skills.
